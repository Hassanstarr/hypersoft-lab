  <meta name="description" content="Within the Hypersoft Research Group, we specialize in crafting advanced mathematical hybrid structures grounded in fuzzy set, soft set, hypersoft set, and neutrosophic set frameworks. Our focus lies in innovating disease diagnostic models tailored for a spectrum of infectious and non-infectious diseases. Additionally, we dedicate our expertise to developing decision support systems for diverse applications, including supply chain management, waste disposal, and conducting techno-economic analyses of materials. These efforts contribute to the evaluation of the sustainability of emerging technological systems shaping the future. Also, our focus extends to predictive modeling of photocatalytic materials using machine learning and AI, with the aim of developing synthesis support models. By integrating these advanced technologies, we aim to enhance the efficiency and precision of our research, pushing the boundaries of innovation in material synthesis and catalyzing advancements in sustainable technological systems." />
